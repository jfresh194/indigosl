The objective is simple — shoot down a targeted number of animals throughout a series of landscapes, in some cases, using precision sniper skills. Not to worry, game developers have added targets on many of the animals, making distance shooting slightly more attainable.",

    "description": "Tongits is a three-player card game that is still in the Rummy family. The objective of the game is to empty your hand cards by forming sets(melds) or minimize the total score when a fight is called or when the central stack is empty. Each player will be dealt 12 cards while the dealer gets 13, and the rest of the cards are left as a draw card. The game begins when the dealer dumps a card. The next person can either pick up the disposed card if that card makes a set or adds to a set they already have or get one from the central stack. Collect hand combinations and dump unnecessary cards. The picking and discarding of cards goes on until someone wins by Tongits, calls a fight, or until the central stack runs out of cards. If this happens, the players tally the points of the cards they have in hand, and the one with the lowest wins. To call a fight, the player needs to put down a meld on the table, and no player drops any card on any of their melds in that round. If the player can use all of their cards in combinations by connecting to opponents’ or the exposed card sets, or if the player gets rid of all their cards, then the player wins by Tongits. Have fun with your friends, enjoy exciting moments, and relieve your stress every day! ",

Sometimes a thief bird will appear and it may have coins and tremendous treasures that you can collect. Click on the thief bird and do not miss it. You can also try using three powerful power-ups such as adding one more heart, resetting the timer and stopping for a while, and removing half of the birds that you can purchase in the shop section. The bird will level up if you find many of the same kind. Collect all of the birds and look at the collections in the birds' book. So, what are you waiting for? Prove your keen eye skills and good luck!",
